This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase's onAuthStateChanged method: forgetting to unsubscribe.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  Failure to unsubscribe leads to memory leaks, especially in components that mount and unmount frequently.  Always ensure to call the unsubscribe function in a cleanup function, such as `componentWillUnmount` in React or within a cleanup effect in React Hooks or similar mechanisms in other frameworks.
